      "This program uses Python's regular expression or regex capabilities to extract information/data using Python's `re` module. To regex some meaniningful expressions, a data file containing meterological information obtained from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) is used. A set of alpha-numerical and numerical datas are extracted using Python's regex. Although note that regex is not the most efficient way to carry out this type of data analysis and interpretation. Here it is just used to show the versatality of regex and to learn using it for Python."

      "The first regex operation that we carry out is the compilation of the header pattern in the `data.txt` file. Compiling the pattern convertes to bytecode, which is then subsequently used to search. At this stage, its ideal to look at the `data.txt` if not already and to find the header information. As we see, the header contains `Product code`, `Bureau of Meteorology station number`, `Year`, `month`, `day`, etc and we try to extract all of these via the `headerPattern` as shown above. Note that we use raw string `r` notation in Python and we also group the regex using `( )`. Grouping regex is a usefull feature when extracting multiple information and they can be assigned with a choice of variable. For example in the above, the `Produce code` is assigned to `pCode` and subsequently when we search for `Product code` we can grab all the associated strings via  `pCode`. This feature will be become clear as we go further."
